# SpeciMate - macOS Installation

## Folder Structure

After extracting the SpeciMate.zip file and copying the other data into the Specimate folder, your folder should contain:

```
SpeciMate/
├── SpeciMate.app         # Main application bundle
├── setup.ini            # Configuration file (use as-is)
└── Data/                # Application data folder
    ├── OCR.livecode     # Core application program
    └── maps/            # Maps subfolder
```

## Installation

1. Extract the SpeciMate.zip file to a location where you have write permissions.
2. Copy the Data folder and setup.ini file to the same directory as SpeciMate.app.
3. The Data folder contains the core OCR.livecode program and the maps subfolder, which are essential for the application to function correctly.

## Important Notes

- The SpeciMate.app is a wrapper application for the main functionality contained in OCR.livecode.
- Ensure you have write permissions to the installation directory.
