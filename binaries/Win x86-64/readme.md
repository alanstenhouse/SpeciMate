# SpeciMate - Windows Installation

## Folder Structure

After extracting the SpeciMate.zip file, your folder should contain:

```
SpeciMate/
├── SpeciMate.exe          # Main application
├── Externals/             # External libraries folder
├── Script Libraries/      # Script libraries folder  
├── setup.ini             # Configuration file (use as-is)
└── Data/                 # Application data folder
    ├── OCR.livecode      # Core application program
    └── maps/             # Maps subfolder
```

## Installation

1. Extract the SpeciMate.zip file to a location where you have write permissions.
2. Copy the Data folder, Script Libraries folder and setup.ini file to the same directory as SpeciMate.app.
3. The Data folder contains the core OCR.livecode program and the maps subfolder.

## Important Notes

- The SpeciMate.exe is a wrapper for the main functionality in OCR.livecode.
- Ensure you have write permissions to the installation directory.
