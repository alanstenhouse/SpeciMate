Specimen metadata extraction software.
Copyright (c) 2024 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) ABN 41 687 119 230. (see the [license file](LICENSE.txt) for details).


This software extracts unstructured or semi-structured data from images and converts it into structured metadata. It is designed to work with biological specimen images, but can be adapted for other types of images and data as well. It uses OCR, translation and Large Language Models (LLMs) to process the images and convert and extract the data.

It has been developed using the LiveCode development environment (https://www.livecode.com) and is available as a standalone application for Windows and Mac.

See the [user guide](<Documentation/SpeciMate User Guide.md>) for more detailed information.
